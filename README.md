**An Intelligent Multi-Agent Healthcare Assistant using OpenAI SDK**

This is an experimental AI-powered medical assistant that simulates a collaborative clinical workflow using large language models (LLMs). The system leverages multiple autonomous agentsâ€”Patient, Doctor, Pharmacist, Knowledge Validator, and Feedback Synthesizerâ€”working together to assess symptoms, deliver medical recommendations, and ensure safe, validated healthcare reasoning.

This project was developed as part of a deep exploration into the capabilities of the OpenAI SDK and the orchestration of multi-agent LLM systems for real-world use cases.

## Features

-  **Patient Agent**  
  Dynamically generates realistic, domain-varied patient complaints (respiratory, neurological, cardiac, etc.).

-  **Doctor Agent**  
  Offers detailed differential diagnoses and outlines recommended diagnostic procedures.

-  **Pharmacist Agent**  
  Suggests medications in structured JSON format, including dosage, safety warnings, and administration advice.

-  **Knowledge Agent**  
  Validates diagnosis and treatment suggestions against simulated literature-based knowledge.

-  **Validator Agent**  
  Cross-verifies all prior outputs and ensures clinical soundness and logical consistency.

-  **Feedback Agent**  
  Simulates patient response to the recommended treatment plan.

-  **Automatic Logging**  
  Full output stored as a structured JSON file (`last_case_log.json`) after each execution for review or audit.
